# Canvas to Paper Tests Project

## Overview

Canvas is a web-based learning manangement system that is widely used by educators. Within Canvas, educators are able to create, modify, and manange different types of assessments. While this feature is essential for online learning, there is not an efficient method to transform these digital assessments into hardcopy tests for in-person classroom settings. Our project, Canvas to Paper Tests, aims to bridge this gap by enabling users to generate hardcopy tests and answer keys from assessments already created in Canvas. The software utilizes Canvasâ€™s Question and Test Interoperability (QTI) capabilities to import and export assessment files. In addition, the user will also be able to create, modify, and manage new assessments, which can then be generated and exported as a printable Word document.

## Features

* **QTI File Management**: Import and export QTI files to and from Canvas.  

* **Assessment Data Management**: Create, modify, and delete quizzes, quiz banks, and quiz questions.
    - Quiz banks contain the set of questions that are included in a quiz. 
    - Modifications made to a quiz bank do not affect quizzes/tests that have already been generated. 
    - Questions can be randomly pulled from a quiz bank or specifically blocked from a quiz.
    - A specific number of points can be assigned to each question and multiple choice answers can be randomized.

* **Test Generation**: Generate assessment materials, such as tests and test keys, in the format of a Word document.
    - Select either a test or key template file in which the generated test questions or test key will be populated to.

* **Question Usage Tracking**: Track question usage to manage assessment content and block specific questions from being reused on a new assessment. 
    - Provide a method to review which questions have been used on which tests. 

* **ABET Integration**: Mark assessment questions for the purpose of ABET score collection.
